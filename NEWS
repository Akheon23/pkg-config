pkg-config 0.17.2
===
 - Don't go into an infinite loop allocating more and more memory when
   the same name is specified twice on the command line and we're in
   "direct dependencies only"-mode.

pkg-config 0.17.1
===
 - Now actually sets CFLAGS and LIBS instead of trying to set those in
   a subshell.  (Only affects if you've autoreconfiscated with 0.17)
 - Fix detection of inter-library dependencies.

pkg-config 0.17
===

 - Evaluate second argument to PKG_CHECK_MODULES again
 - Portability fixes (MacOS, BeOS, Cygwin)
 - Handle inter-library dependencies and assume those are in place if
   the platform supports them.  Disable with --enable-indirect-deps.
 - Add initial test framework
 - Build fixes (make distcheck now works)

pkg-config 0.16
===

 - Use a search path, rather than a single default directory.
 - Fix a bunch of bugs in glib by backporting
 - More man page fixes
 - Lots of small fixes and cleanups over the place.
 - pkg-config now grabs _PKG_* and PKG_*, so don't use variables
   starting with that in any configure scripts.

pkg-config 0.15
===

 - add PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR for cross-compiling (David Schleef)
 - add --libs-only-other/--cflags-only-other (Zack Rusin)
 - apply man page fixes (Pter Breitenlohner)
 - C portability fix (David Robins)
